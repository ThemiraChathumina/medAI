# Medical Image Analysis with AI

This application leverages AI to analyze medical images, specifically brain images and chest X-rays. Users can upload medical images, get predictions about potential issues, and verify or correct these predictions. The application ensures a smooth and secure user experience through a robust authentication system.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login system to protect user data.
- **Medical Image Analysis**: Upload and analyze brain images and chest X-rays.
- **AI Predictions**: Get AI-generated predictions for uploaded images.
- **User Verification**: Verify or correct AI predictions to improve accuracy.
- **Responsive Design**: User-friendly interface
